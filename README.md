Configure CORS for containers on Azure Blob Storage
==================

This console app was written by referencing a couple of different blog posts including these below. Each of these posts had thier own problems, so I thought I would write my own.

This was written for Visual Studio 2013

Open this repo in VS2013 and run it from the debugger, that should be sufficient, nothing fancy. Hopefully MS will release a GUI version on Azure to make this easier to deal with and consequently obviate this repo.
